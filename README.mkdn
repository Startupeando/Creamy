# Creamy

A delicously tiny content management system as simple as perch.

## Usage

1. Open `creamy.php` with a text editor and configure usernames and
   passwords.

2. Upload `creamy.php` and the `creamy` folder to your server.

3. Call creamy within your static pages:  

```php
<?php require_once("creamy.php"); ?>
```

4. Create a content area (an editable region) wherever you want:  

```php
<?php Creamy::content("news"); ?>
```

5. Open the backend at `example.com/creamy` and edit the content area.


## Features

### Markdown support

Content areas (the text files included in your page) can be formatted with [Markdown][1].  
The syntax is easy to learn and makes for great formatting (you can also
disable Markdown support altogether).

### Templating engine

Creamy uses twig for templating.  
It's pretty awesome. There is [lots of documentation][2].

### Themes

Themes are common parts of a website which will not be editable -- like headers, footers and sidebars.
Put them into a folder called `theme` (relative to `creamy.php`).
You can now use it on any page like this:  

```php
<?php Creamy::theme("header"); ?>
```

### Variables

Let's get fancy! You can use variables in your themes and content
areas:

Let's say you have a variable named {{ title }}Â inside a theme file.
Here is how to fill it with a value:

```php
<?php $options = array("title" => "Creamy awesomeness!"); ?>
<?php Creamy::theme("header", $options); ?>
```

Or you might want a different layout (here: table.html) 
for a content area and also omit markdown support for this area.  
Here is how to do it:  

```php
<?php 
  $options = array("layout" => "table", "markdown" => false);
  Creamy::content("events", $options);
?>
```

### Metadata

You can place metadata at the head of every markdown file like this:

    author: Oscar Wilde
    year: 1883
    title: Personal Impressions of America (Leadville)
    ---
    Over the piano was printed a notice:  
    Please do not shoot the pianist. He is doing his best.

The first three lines are interpreted as metadata and can be used in
your templates like this:  

```php
{% for post in posts %}
  {{ post.title }}, written by {{ post.author }} in {{ post.year }}:
  {{ post.text }}
{% endfor %}
```

## FAQ

#### Q: A CMS...oh really? Why don't you use one of the gazillion other systems?
A: I want a lightweight CMS that happily adapts to static layouts not the other way round.

#### Q: Why not use perch instead?
A: Creamy is more flexible and it is free software. You can modify it to your hearts content.
Furthermore it's file based. You don't need a database to run it.
Also, I personally prefer an erb/mustache/twig-like templating engine
over the XML-style one that comes with perch.

#### Q: Why not use jekyll instead?
A: I love jekyll. I use it for my own blog but it's cumbersome to
configure and has no admin backend for my clients. You can think of creamy as a
user-friendly jekyll clone.

#### Q: Who might want to use it?
A: Creamy is ideal for small web pages.
It doesn't get into your way and helps you get some dynamic elements
into otherwise static pages real quick.
You can create a simple template and publish content in no time.

Hackers can also use source control software like git or svn and a plain
text editor to manage sites.
